The PyTorch Implementation of *ICML 2023 Poster -- "Towards Omni-generalizable Neural Methods for Vehicle Routing Problems"* by [Jianan Zhou](https://royalskye.github.io), [Yaoxin Wu](https://research.tue.nl/en/persons/yaoxin-wu), [Wen Song](https://songwenas12.github.io), [Zhiguang Cao](https://zhiguangcaosg.github.io), [Jie Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/zhangj).

### TL;DR

This paper studies a challenging yet realistic setting, which considers generalization across both size and distribution (a.k.a. omni-generalization) of neural methods in VRPs. Technically, a general meta-learning framework is developed to tackle it.
